        <h2>About Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>An ecosystem is a complex, interconnected community of living organisms and their physical environment. It encompasses both the living organisms (biotic factors) and the non-living components (abiotic factors) of a specific area, all of which interact and influence one another. Ecosystems come in various sizes and can be as small as a pond or as large as a forest or an entire biome.</p>

    <h2>Key Components of Ecosystems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biotic Factors:</strong> These are the living organisms within an ecosystem, including plants, animals, microorganisms, and humans. These organisms interact with each other through various relationships like predation, competition, and mutualism.</li>
        <li><strong>Abiotic Factors:</strong> These are the non-living components of an ecosystem, such as soil, water, air, temperature, and sunlight. Abiotic factors have a significant impact on the types of organisms that can survive in a particular ecosystem.</li>
        <li><strong>Producers:</strong> Producers, often plants, are the foundation of an ecosystem. They use sunlight and inorganic compounds to produce energy through photosynthesis, which is the basis for all life in the ecosystem.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumers:</strong> Consumers are organisms that feed on other organisms. They are categorized into different trophic levels, such as herbivores (plant-eaters), carnivores (meat-eaters), and omnivores (eating both plants and animals).</li>
        <li><strong>Decomposers:</strong> These organisms, like bacteria and fungi, break down dead organic matter and recycle nutrients back into the ecosystem. They play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem health.</li>
    </ul>
